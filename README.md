# ImagiNet 🖼

Hey there! 👋 How are you?

I know there are tons of websites for finding pictures online and more. But guess what? I decided to create my own. It's been a great way to practice using React and TypeScript, and I've added a cool feature – lazy image loading.

By the way, I'm still working on adding new stuff to it. If you like what you see, don't forget to give the repo a star ⭐️. Thanks for taking a look, and have a wonderful day!
